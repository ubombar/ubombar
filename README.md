## 🔬 Current Research

I'm a first-year PhD student focused on **Internet measurements** and **routing security**, particularly on:
- 📊 Scalable traceroute data processing
- 🌍 BGP hijack detection and analysis
- 🧪 Designing reproducible network experiments
- 📖 Blending philosophy of science with empirical systems work

My research involves end-to-end development of measurement platforms, from **data collection pipelines** to **interactive dashboards** and **backend infrastructure**.

## 🧰 Projects

- 🧭 `traceroute-parser`: CLI tool to parse large-scale traceroute data to ClickHouse-compatible formats.
- 📈 `jour`: A command-line knowledge base manager for journaling and research notes.
- 🧪 `bgp-lab`: A virtual lab to simulate and analyze BGP hijack scenarios.
- 📝 `htmx-comment-app`: Minimalist comment system built with Go and HTMX.

## 🧠 Philosophy + Engineering

I enjoy exploring the intersection of theory and practice — from Gödel’s theorems and the philosophy of measurement to writing fast and elegant command-line tools. I’m currently reading 📚 *Gödel, Escher, Bach* and thinking about how foundational ideas inform robust software design.
